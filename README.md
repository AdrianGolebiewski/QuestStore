![alt hydro1](http://www.lukaszkedziora.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/qs1.jpg)

The project is an MVC website written in C# based on REST API architecture and SPA front. The application offers several functionalities such as: choosing  quests, buying bonuses, earning golden coins. The page gives you the opportunity to login and register as Admin, Mentor or Student. Each of these roles has a personalized menu. Admin has full CRUD options regarding students, mentors, groups, bonuses, and quests. Mentors have the same privilege as Admin with one exception only - users administration. Finally, students can view their accounts, buy bonuses, and choose quests.     

#### [I invite you to see the website!](http://queststore.hostingasp.pl/)

## What is the page about?

This page has several functions: it's a fictional quest and bonus store, but also my demo website, and a challenge for you. At the bottom of this section you will find login and password to the app. It doesn't matter if you are a friend of mine, a CEO from Silicon Valley, or an honest and decent businessman or businesswoman from Toruń. You should login and be ready for what happens. If this Demo turns out satisfying and you admire chihuahuas as much as we do, please contact us. It will be a pleasure to develop some web pages or more advanced web applications for you. You can login as Admin, Mentor or Student. 

Have fun!
